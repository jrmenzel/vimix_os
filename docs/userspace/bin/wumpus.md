# Hunt the Wumpus

A _Wumpus_ is a creature that lives in a cave with several rooms connected by tunnels. You wander among the rooms, trying to shoot the _Wumpus_ with an arrow, meanwhile avoiding being eaten by the _Wumpus_ and falling into _Bottomless Pits_. There are also _Super Bats_ which are likely to pick you up and drop you in some random room. The program asks various questions which you answer one per line; it will give a more detailed description if you want.

This program is based on one described in "People's Computer Company," (November 1973).

### BUGS

It will never replace Space War.


## History

Hunt the Wumpus was originally developed by Gregory Yob in 1973. See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus. The source and description above are based on the UNIX version 7 source by Ken Thompson, updated to compile on a modern C compiler.
