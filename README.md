# VIMIX OS Readme

VIMIX OS is a small Unix like OS which started as a fork of [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) (which is a partial re-implementation of Unix version 6 for [RISC V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) 64-bit).

See [README-xv6](docs/README-xv6.md) for original xv6 contributors.
