While the hardware comes with a device tree in flash (together with U-Boot), 
it seems often to be incomplete or outdated. The device tree binaries (*.dtb) 
will get loaded into memeory from the boot loader to replace the build in ones. 
The source versions (*.dts) are present for completeness.

The device trees come from the Linux images of the respective boards.
